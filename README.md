# Credit Score Classification with Machine Learning
Banks and credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness. Today banks and credit card companies use Machine Learning algorithms to classify all the customers in their database based on their credit history. 

Classifying customers based on their credit scores helps banks and credit card companies immediately issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness. A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution. 

There are three credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:

1) Good
2) Standard
3) Poor
